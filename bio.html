                    roxanne is a human being that currently lives in northern indiana (üá∫üá∏). she gets most reliably paid for her work in digital media and web development at the various tech startups that have employed her in the past. she usually works remotely but will occasionally apparate into a physical office when summoned (promises of ice-cold la croix and hot coffee work well).
                </p>

                <p> roxanne likes working on fast-paced, exciting projects with a lot of small, different moving parts. this is due to a strange hyperactivity that has afflicted her since childhood that drove her to always be reading at least five books at once, doodling on every flat(ish) surface she encountered, and <strike>bossing around</strike> leading large groups of neighborhood children on various "adventures" of her own invention. her therapist says unfortunately, there is no cure. but on the brightside, 9 out of 10 professional references will agree that such traits make her an excellent, albeit a little overzealous, employee. </p>

                <p> she enjoys creating things that make people happy (like actually happy not colorful opiate candy on a friday night happy). however, she prefers to do this creating in quiet, solitary spaces with minimal distractions. someone once told her she has an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">infj</a> personality type and she identifies with that horoscope much more strongly than the zodiac one (ü¶Ç). </p>
                <p>if you are interested in contacting roxanne for career oppurtunities, freelance work, or just to gab about how the curvature of kit harrington's butt matches the golden ratio inexplicably well please email her at <a href="mailto:roxanne.coburn@gmail.com?Subject=kit%20harringtons%20butt" target="_top" title="roxanne.coburn@gmail.com">roxanne.coburn@gmail.com</a></p>
